The F06 Reader/Writer was added in v0.4.

# F06 Reader #
The F06 Reader can read Nastran F06 files.  It is less capable than the OP2 Reader in terms of number of results that it can read, but it does read a few tables that don't exist in the OP2.

When results exist in the OP2, the same OP2 objects to store the data, so see the [OP2 wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/wiki/OP2) to see how to access those data members.

# F06 Writer #
The F06 Writer is integrated in with the F06 class as well as the OP2 class.  This allows a user to verify that their data was read properly and also will be useful if you're writing your own solver and want to write an F06 file.

## How to Use ##
Note these arguments will change to be more consistent with the OP2 reader
```
from pyNastran.f06.f06 import F06
f06 = F06(f06Name) ## @todo add log, debug
#f06.setF06Name(f06Name)
f06.readF06()    ## @todo move f06Name here?
f06.writeF06(f06NameAlt)

# op2 version
from pyNastran.op2.op2 import OP2
op2 = OP2(op2file,makeGeom=False,debug=False,log=None)
op2.readOP2()
op2.writeF06(f06NameAlt)

# f06 testing version
cd pyNastran/f06
python f06.py model.f06 > junk.out   # parses the f06 and creates model.f06.out

# op2 testing version
test_op2 model.op2 > junk.out   # parses the op2 and creates model.f06.out
```

## Implementing the F06 Writer in a User-Defined Solver ##
Take a look at the pyNastran/f06/tables/oug.py and the getDisplacement() method.  You need to create the dataCode dictionary and populate the object by displacementObject by using the addF06Data() method.

Assuming you know the F06 table you're trying to create, just look at the reader for that table and copy most of the code.  Fill in your data where applicable.

## OP2 Writer - Future Work ##
Someday there will be a corresponding OP2 Writer that will have basically the same interface.  Assuming your code works with the F06 Writer, using the OP2 Writer as well will be easy.  A few more inputs may be required to dataCode, but not much else.
