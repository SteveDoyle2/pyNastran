---Format Specific---

Nastran
=======
 - load geometry -> .bdf/nas/dat/op2
   - shows CAERO panels
   - change between sub-element and element using dynamic menu
   - element quality metrics

 - load results -> op2
   - SOL 101
     - (nodal/centroidal) stress
     - (nodal) displacement, velocity, acceleration, spc_forces, mpc_forces, temperatures
     - displacement shown as displaced model
   - Stress/Strain
     - rod_stress, bar_stress, **beam_stress, plate_stress, solid_stress
     - composite_plate_stress (centroidal only)
   - Force
     - rod_force, bar_force
 - transient-style results
    - eigenvectors (real/complex)
    - same options as in static (e.g., displacement, rod stress)
    - no other complex results

 - rotate loads based on local coordinate system
   - displacement (e.g. force, displacement, velocity) done
   - TODO: stress (y/z vs. hoop) -> R.T @ stress @ R

 - multiple op2 files

 - CAERO panels
   - CAERO panel actor
   - CAERO aerobox actor
   - AEFACT flap actor
   - SPLINE actor
   - SPLINE points actor
   - TODO: data label for CAERO cards
     - as a element number (low priority)

 - TODO: different nodal averaging methods (e.g.derive/avg, avg/derive)
 - TODO: interface loads
 - secondary actors
   - CAERO, 123 SPCs, MPC/RBE, SUPORT1, SUPORT, CONM2, SPOINTs
   - bars orientation

Cart3d
======
 - load geometry -> tri/triq
   - nodal -> eid
   - centroidal -> nid, NormalX, NormalY, NormalZ
 - Power BCs (requires input.cntl)
   - centroidal -> Rho, XVelocity, YVelocity, ZVelocity, Pressure
 - results
   - nodal -> Mach, Cp, rho, rhoU, rhoV, rhoW, rhoE, U, V, W, E
   - NOTE: centroidal main results removed because nodal & centroidal
           are now supported, so there's no need to see the results 
 - secondary actors
   - box with inflow/outflow/symmetry/farfield boundary conditions as colors

 - show/hide elements based on picking

Panair
======
 - load geometry -> inp
   - centroidal -> patch number, area x/y/z centroid location
   - nodal -> x/y/z node location
 - supports auto-reload of geometry
 - load results -> agps
   - nodal/centroidal - > Cp
 - show/hide panels based on groups

LaWGS
=====
 - load geometry -> wgs
 - TODO: Coordinate System

Tecplot
=======
 - load geometry -> dat/plt
   - ASCII
     - tri, quad, tetra, and hexa support
     - multiblock support
     - TODO: parsing of structured grids
   - Binary
     - hexas only
     - Tecplot360 format ONLY
     - little? endian only
     - TODO: tri, quad, and tetra support
     - TODO: multiblock support
     - TODO: multifile loader
       - currently need to hardcode the GUI to do a multiread
     - TDOO: support for Tecplot 2010
     - TODO: full parsing of binary data
     - TODO: multiple endians
     - TODO: parsing of structured grids
 - Coordinate System

Tetgen
======
 - load geometry -> smesh
 - TODO: Coordinate System

STL
===
 - load geometry -> STL
 - Coordinate System

S/HABP
======
 - geometry (mk5/geo/inp)
   - location, patch number, component, impact, shadow
 - TODO: full trailer parsing
 - TODO: results parsing
 - TODO: show/hide panels based on menu/picking

Usm3d
=====
 - load geometry -> cogsg/front
 - load results -> flo, .aux.flo
   - old results not cleared out if loading both flo & aux.flo, so be careful
 - supports auto-reload of geometry and guesses for the latest result file

 - dynamic mapbc/bc file loading when input file loaded (if available)
 - dynamic flo output file loading on input
   - model_%i.flo will be found on load_geometry; where %i is the biggest number
     - supports autoreload
   - specific results file can be loaded with load results
 - TODO: Coordinate System (???)

Fast
====
 - load geometry

BEdge
=====
 - load geometry -> mdodel.bedge

UGrid
=====
 - AFLR format
 - load geometry -> model.b8.ugrid
  - b8, l8, etc. required
  - nodes/elements of surface mesh
 - auto-loads a tags file to plot boundary conditions

Surf
====
 - AFLR format
 - load geometry -> model.surf
  - nodes/elements of surface mesh
 - auto-loads a tags file to plot boundary conditions

#--------------
# BUGS

nastran
=======
- single results (e.g. pid) can't have their legends edited
  - is this still true?
- the Isat model seems to have something wrong with the Pid (in what way???)
  - is this still true?
- elements with pid=0 corresponds to:
  - CONROD
  - CELAS2/4
  - buggy cards

panair

cart3d

shabp
=======
- trailer doesn't always parse properly

plot3d
=======
- doesn't work at all

tecplot
=======
- likely issue with various solid elements (inside out)
