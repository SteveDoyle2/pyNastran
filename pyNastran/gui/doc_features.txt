    - incrementing files for Usm3d (e.g. running a job and want to watch the
      flow develop without having to click load_results)

   - title
   - min/max value
   - data format (%f, %e, %g, %i, %.4f)

     - TODO: should maybe remove the OK button and rename Cancel to Close

 - animation menu
   - scale factor with multiple animation options (e.g., linear, sinusoidal)
   - complex results (phase)

 - focal point picking (e.g. clipping)
   - "f" key & button
   - zoom out far, press f to disable clipping
   - zoom in to desired view distance and press f to set clip plane
     - cart3d can clip through bounding box to pick nodes/elements
       that are obscured

 - minor features
   - default filename for pictures
   - pretty window title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
     - TODO: outfile is incorrect listed if you load a new geometry

   - button
   - TODO: come up with better method for zooming; it doesn't work right (does a double zoom)

 - rotate/snap buttons

 - command line
   - loading of geometry/results from command line
   - python scripting
   - disable HTML output (useful for when PySide2/PyQt5 is buggy)

 - result probe
   - cell/node picking based on result type
   - kind of a hackish picking method
   - no nodal/centroidal position picking (e.g. get (x, y, z), not just x or y or z)

 - distance probe
   - similar method to results probe
   - note in the message area at the bottom
   - TODO: add a notice that you're picking the second point
           maybe a note in the log
           maybe a visualization (e.g., a node) on the model)
           maybe switch this to allow use to reselect 1st/2nd points repeatedly

   - multiple nastran subcases
   - load in custom CSV results
   - TODO: working on double main actors

Future Nastran Features
======================================
 - geometry
    - create coordinate system (could come from BDF)
 - results
    - displacement transform
      - plot radial deformation as a fringe (requies coords)
    - "displacement" options
      - plot X/Y/Z (or R, theta, phi) as a fringe
      - select displacement components to consider to create fringe
        - X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ, XYZ (current)
      - select displacement components to consider to create deformatio
        - X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ, XYZ (current)

Nastran Stress
--------------
- stress transforms
  - requies coords
  - requires treating stress as a matrix & not a scalar
    - xform is unique to each element type
- "stress" options (element force is basically the same)
  - core results
    - plate:    oxx, oyy, txy, omax, omin, ovm
    - pshell:   oxx, oyy, ozz, txy, tyz, txz, omax, omid, omin, ovm, tmax (for top/bottom)
    - pcomp:    oxx, oyy, ozz, txy, tyz, txz, omax, omid, omin, ovm, tmax (for each layer)
    - spring:   oxx
    - bar:      oxx, ozz, txz, A/B/C/D
        - combined: oxx, oyy, txy, omax, omin


Nastran Centroidal Stress
-------------------------
- use the absolute max for a given element and plot is as the value
  - same as we do now
- have options:
  - across the same element (see core results):
    - select core result group:
      - pshell: (top/bottom/both);              default=both
      - pcomp:  (layer1-10; layer1/3/4/5; all); default=all
    - select core result type (e.g., oxx, ovm)

- Step 1:
  - select core result

- Step 2: (optional)
  - coordinate transform

- Step 3:
  - Operate centroidally and reduces the stress to a single value
    - pshell: top/bottom reduction
    - pcomp:  across N layers
    - spring, rod, solid:  nothing!
    - bar/beam: A/B/C/D stress

|   - A, B, C, D (bars)    |

+--------------------------+
| - Transform              |
|  - coord ID              | Step 2: pulldown; (optional/skip)
+--------------------------+

+--------------------------+

|  - min, max, average     | Step 4: pulldown
+--------------------------+

|  - across all elements   | Step 5: greyed checkbox
+--------------------------+


- Step 1: (results window)
  - select core result

- Step 2: (optional)
  - coordinate transform

- Step 3:  (results window)
  - Operate nodally and reduces the stress to a single value
    - pshell: top/bottom reduction
    - pcomp:  across N layers
    - spring, rod, solid:  nothing!
    - bar/beam: A/B/C/D stress

- Step 4: (derivation method; pulldown)
  - Operate "across" the boundary
  - max, min, derive/average (default)
    - TODO: average/derive
    - max doesn't exist for max principal stress
    - min doesn't exist for min principal stress, von mises, or max shear

- Step 5: Nodal Combine (merge results from different elements; pulldown)
  - just stick it at the centroid
    - for example, nodal average at the nodes and then take
      that worst value and stick it at the centroid
    - just stick it at the centroid abs?
  - across all elements
    - for example, nodal average at the nodes
  - across similar element family (shells average with shells)
    - ***requires multiple actors; hard stop***
    - A CTRIA3 and CQUAD4 with the same PSHELL are the same family.
    - Are a PBAR  and PBARL  in the same family?
    - Are a PBEAM and PBEAML in the same family?
      - I'm going with no
    - Are a PCOMP and PSHELL in the same family?
      - I'm going with no
  - across the same property_id (and element family)
    - ***requires multiple actors; hard stop***
  - across the same material_id (and property_id and element family)
    - ***requires multiple actors; hard stop***

Step 5 is "cut"
  - use "across all elements"
  - use "just stick it at the centroid"
