PyQt4/PyQt5/PySide unique
=========================
 - logger

 - buttons/pulldowns for:
   - implicit pulldown for formats
   - zoom/rotate/snap to axis
   - screenshot
   - auto-reload
   - results sidebar

 - auto-reload button.  Useful for:
    - creating Nastran aero panels
    - modifying Panair file
    - dynamically updating files
    - incrementing files for Usm3d (e.g. running a job and want to watch the
      flow develop without having to click load_results)

 - legend menu to edit properties for:
   - title
   - min/max value
   - data format (%f, %e, %g, %i, %.4f)
   - red to blue; blue to red
   - nlabels, ncolors
   - save results
   - can't move legend
     - horizontal/veterical
     - TODO: can't explicitly place it
   - show/hide legend
   - animation
   - TODO: Cancel button doesn't go to original settings if you click apply
     - TODO: should maybe remove the OK button and rename Cancel to Close

 - secondary actors menu
   - actor selection
     - color
     - point size
     - line size
     - opacity
     - show/hide
   - coordinate systems
     - show/hide
   - selective editing based on representation

 - focal point picking (e.g. clipping)
   - "f" key & button
   - zoom out far, press f to disable clipping
   - zoom in to desired view distance and press f  to 
     - cart3d can clip through bounding box to pick nodes/elements
       that are obscured

 - minor features
   - default filename for pictures
   - pretty window title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
     - TODO: outfile is incorrect listed if you load a new geometry

 - zoom
   - button
   - TODO: come up with better method for zooming; it doesn't work right (does a double zoom)

 - rotate/snap buttons

 - command line
   - loading of geometry/results from command line
   - python scripting
   - edges
   - disable HTML output (useful for when PyQt is buggy)

 - result probe
   - cell/node picking based on result type
   - kind of a hackish picking method
   - no nodal/centroidal position picking (e.g. get (x, y, z), not just x or y or z)

 - distance probe
   - similar method to results probe
   - note in the message area at the bottom
   - TODO: add a notice that you're picking the second point
           maybe a note in the log
           maybe a visualization (e.g., a node) on the model)
           maybe switch this to allow use to reselect 1st/2nd points repeatedly

 - results sidebar
   - data is put in a nested tree and cycleResults works (Control+L)
   - multiple nastran subcases
   - load in custom CSV results
   - TODO: working on double main actors

 - Python console scripting menu
   - modify unexposed data members
     - high resolution screenshots
     - animations
   - powerful tool for quickly creating a command line script
   - syntax highlighting with QScintilla (PyQt4)
     - TODO: remove QScintilla because it's inconsistent???
     - font is courier new

 - groups
   - create groups by Nastran properties (Nastran-specific)
   - show/hide elements by group
     - TODO: allow selection of more than one group
     - TODO: show/hide elements based on picking
     - TODO: improved picking
