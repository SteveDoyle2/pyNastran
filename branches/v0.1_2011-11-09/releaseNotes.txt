---v0.1---
See "RoadMap.txt" for a list of the BDF cards that are supported.
It's nice and long :)

This document discusses the major features (and limitations) added in each
version of the software.  See the HTML documentation for more information.

Overall
   - an executive control deck, case control deck, and bulk data deck
     are REQUIRED.
   - A ENDDATA card is strongly recommened!
   - Mass/Stiffness Matricies not supported except in a few, rare cases.
   - superelements are NOT supported
   - loads need some TLC in v0.2, but there is minor support for them
   - see the HTML documenation for a list of object data and methods.
     The Nastran QRG (Quick Reference Guide) is another good reference.
   - This code was written entirely in Python and should install easily.

Executive Control Deck
   - Include files NOT supported
   - Limited to LESS than 200 lines
   - Extract soltion and method (if sol=600)
   - Can update solution/method

Case Control Deck
   - Include files supported (dont cross the BEGIN BULK entry)
   - Limited to LESS than 200 lines
   - In general, if a card is supported, EVERY field can be read,
     accessed, and written.
   - Most cards forms supported
      1.  STRESS(PLOT,PUNCH) = ALL     #  name(options) = value  (STRESS-type)
      2.  STRESS = ALL                 #  name = value           (STRESS-type)
      3.  DISP(PLOT,PUNCH) = ALL       #  name(options) = value  (STRESS-type)
      4.  PARAM,FIXEDB,-1              #  name, options, value   (PARAM-type)
      5.  SET 1 = 1,2,3,4, etc.        #  name id = options      (SET-type)
   - Some forms not supported
      1.  AUTOSPC (PRINT, PUNCH, SID=100, EPS=1.E-6, MPC)=YES      (AUTOSPC=YES is supported)
      2.  MODALSE(ESORT=ASCEND,THRESH=.0001)= 100
      3.  MODESELECT (FLUID LMODES = 5)
      4.  OUTPUT(XYOUT)
      5.  TFL = 1, 25, 77
      6.  SURFACE 10 SET 9 NORMAL X3
      7.  VOLUME 21 SET 2
   - Methods to update global/local subcase values


BDF Data Deck (no cross referencing required)
   - include files supported
   - 8/16 character fields, csv format for cards is supported.  DONT USE TABS!!!
   - Cards are written in 8-character fields and make use of Nastran-scientific
     notation to maximize precision.
   - write and writeAsPatran methods to write the bdf file after modifying it.
     The write method writes each 'section' (e.g. nodes/elements/properties)
     as isolated sections.  writeAsPatran intersperses properties and elements.
   - Duplicate node/element/property/etc. IDs are NOT allowed!

Bulk Data Deck Cross-Referencing
   - Entire deck is read.  If a card isnt supported, it is rejected.  Unparsed
     cards are clearly marked in the $REJECTS or $REJECT_LINES sections.
   - Cross-referencing is a feature that links data from one card to another.
     An example is a CQUAD4 has four nodes.  When cross-referenced, the element
     object's nodes become node objects.
   - Coordinate systems are a work in progress and difficult to test without
     good test cases.  Feel free to add some.  Therefore, the global coordinate
     system is safest and is the only one supported at the moment (CORD2R).
   - In order to determine element information that requires information from
     other cards, cross-referencing is REQUIRED.  The read method has the
     option to disable this.
   - When using constraints, all constraints (SPC,SPC1,SPCD,MPC) must be
     part of an SPCADD or MPCADD, unless there are no SPCADDs or MPCADDs.
     In other words, DONT mix and match!
   - Structural elements have a mass/area/length depending on type.
   - Volume ONLY supported for TET4 and TET10
   - Lots of methods for PCOMPs
   - CBEAM elements do are not complete for their area/mass/etc calcuations.
   - Moments of intertias of elements are not calculated.
   - Stiffness Matricies are incomplete
