This document is a process for improving the quality (testability/documentation) of pyNastran.

Effective starting on version:    XXX (0.7???)
Releases before API deprecation:  0.1  (each new release will cause a deprecation warning)
Releases before API removal:      0.2  (you get one version to fix it)

==============================================================================
Upon getting the official version stamp the following applies:
    Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
    http://semver.org/

# Summary
=========
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
  - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  - PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
#===================================================================
Maintenance
===========
Code maintenance is a pain.  pyNastran is not well funded and as such
will not maintain versions prior to the previous PATCH release.  If in
20 years, you want to run pyNastran, go install the old version.  It's
a big project and as such, there are warts (kinda like Nastran), so
rather than maintaining bugs, we'll fix them slowly.

In the case of a MAJOR release, hopefully, it won't be that different.

#===================================================================
Code Style
==========
To facilitate scripting, classes should follow the following style:
   1.  Classes are defined with object or the parent:
       class ASDF(object):
	   class ASDF(FDSA):
   2.  No Python comments on the class line
   3.  Classes should not be indented
   4.  Class methods are indented 4 spaces
   5.  "self" is used in all methods as the first argument
   6.  No Python comments on the method line

To facilitate scripting, functions should follow the following style:
   1.  Functions are not indented
   2.  No Python comments on the function line

PEP-8
=====
Ideally the entire code would follow PEP-8.  It doesn't.  API changes WILL follow PEP-8.

Some complexity exists for certain methods.  Some problematic methods are as follows:
   - Area()   method vs. self.area variable
   - Length() consistency with Area method
   - Ixx()    ixx() would be a less desirable way to get the moment of inertia

Some approaches for Area() include:
   1. change self.area to self._area; change Area() to area()
     * I dislike this as we're changing two things
   2. change Area() to get_area()
     * this makes it obvious the function doesn't take an argument
       (it's a getter, not a setter)

I like Option #2.  It follows PEP-8 and is clear.

Some approaches for Ixx() include:
   - change self.ixx to self._ixx (if _ixx exists); change Ixx() to get_ixx()
     * I dislike this as we're potentially changing two things
	 * I dislike this as Ixx() looks better
   - change Ixx() to get_Ixx()
     * it doesn't follow PEP-8
	 * it's obvious the function doesn't take an argument (it's a getter, not a setter)

I like Option #2.  It doesn't follow PEP-8 exactly, but is more clear.
PEP-8 has a "rules are made to be broken" clause, so why not use it?

#===================================================================
Frequent Code Errors
====================
Options:
 1. Develop new code in a branch and allow the branch to fail
  .   - Disadvantages:  It's basically a sub-release then and merging is a pain
 2. Develop new code in the trunk and allow the branch to fail
      - We've flipped the direction, but accomplished nothing vs Option 1
 3. Allow for errors to enter into the trunk and just fix them quickly
	  - A machine that runs automated testing would help to identify
	    errors and keep it in the working state.
      - Preferred as it:
	      * Minimizes branching
          * Encourages new tests

NOTE:  Code in a dev folder (e.g. dev_vectorized) is allowed to fail as it's dev code

#===================================================================
Automated Testing
=================
One of the biggest issues with pyNastran is that there is no automated testing.  
The code is developed on machines where tests are run intermittently.  
Thus, it regularly goes from a working state to a non-working state.

There are two basic classes of tests:
  - unit tests (they should all pass unless they're known failures)
  - mass testing of every file in the nastran tpl directory (as a BDF/OP2/F06)

Unit Tests
==========
Unit tests are run semi-regularly, but often uncover bugs when they are run.  
A system like Buildbot would help this.  
Improved coverage would obviously reduce bugs, but better test problems 
would need to be created.

Buildbot Package Requirements
=============================
Buildbot doesn't exist for pyNastran, but if it did, it should test
against some specified versions of Python/numpy/scipy/etc.  pyNastran
tries to be liberal with versioning, which is in conflict with the
specified version requirement.  Thus, two setup.py scripts could be created.

For example:
  - setup.py                    (liberal versioning)
  - setup_explicit_versions.py (explicit versioning)


Mass Testing
============
Mass testing is also useful in that it tests many cards in a wide
variety of input styles.  Here, a simple check of what tests passed
and which tests failed could be stored.

If any tests go from passing to failing the code should fail and print
those test files.  The resolution should either be to say the test was
wrong and fix it or say the test was correct and the model is bad (and
is thus removed from the passing test list).

If a test goes from failing to passing, the model should be added to
the passing list.

#===================================================================
Documentation
=============
Classes/functions should be documented with proper 
inputs/outputs/types/errors/gotchas.  Some issues include:
  1.  There are many duplicate functions
  2.  API changes
  3.  Fast & Loose
  4.  Releasable vs. Non-Releasable
  5.  The Code is Big

Documentation Style
===================
Sphinx documentation will be used (as opposed to Doxygen).  
It is much more standard across Python.

All new functions/methods must be appropriately documented 
(per the Duplicate Functions section).  All Sphinx warnings relating
to incorrect parameter names/missing variables (due to half implemented
documentation) are errors.  In other words, it's not documented at all
(only applying to existing functions) or it's documented correctly.

BDF cards (e.g. GRID, CQUAD4, PSHELL) should have a QRG-style table at
the class level, while the __init__ can effectively be empty
(per Duplicate Functions) because it has the following signature:
   __init__(self, card=None, data=None)

Duplicate Functions
===================
Every BDF card object has a write_bdf, __str__, rawFields, etc. method
that is overwritten from the parent BaseCard.  Similarly, a CONROD, 
CROD, CBAR, and CBEAM card each have a Mass method.  It seems like a lot
of extra work to document how each Mass method works when there is very
similar code in each location (e.g. a CONROD gets the area from itself,
while a CROD gets area from a PROD, but the formula for mass is the same).

Thus is proposed that "obvious" functions (e.g. Length/Mass) are 
documented at the earliest common ancestor of an object 
(e.g. RodElement), which is then overwritten by a CONROD/CROD object.
While the implementation is different, the Mass is still 
mass=length*(area*rho+nsm).  For an element like CTRIA3/CQUAD4 also has
a Mass, but because it is computed differently (area*mass_per_area+nsm),
where mass_per_area is different for a PSHELL or PCOMP, it must have a
different explanation.

For an "obvious" function like write_bdf, __str__, or rawFields that
exist for every card are defined at the BaseCard level and not defined
on the 200+ card objects.

API Changes
===========
# Deprecation process
For a class function to be deprecated from the BDF class:
  1. Create a parent class (BDF_Deprecated) that has the old method and includes:
        - when it will be deprecated as part of the deprecation warning/documentation
		- how to update the call signature
		- does not contain any "extra" code
		- call the new method or in the case of code removal
		  has the entire function
  2. Wait until the specified version number and delete the deprecated
     code class as part of bumping versions.
NOTE:  If a function in v1.1 is to be deprecated=v1.2 and removed=v1.3
       and we double bump (due to a bug), the version numbers for may
       be changed to deprecated=v1.3 and removed=1.4.  A double bump
       is a defined as:

Q: What do I do if I accidentally release a backwards incompatible
   change as a minor version?

A: As soon as you realize that you've broken the Semantic Versioning
   spec, fix the problem and release a new minor version that corrects
   the problem and restores backwards compatibility. Even under this
   circumstance, it is unacceptable to modify versioned releases.  If
   it's appropriate, document the offending version and inform your
   users of the problem so that they are aware of the offending version.


For a new required parameter/change in functionality:
  1. See #Deprecation Process

For a new optional parameter that doesn't change the function's result if ignored:
  1. document the parameter

For improved support of an optional parameter (e.g. moment center as
a int (GRID ID) or (NEW) triple list representing a coordinate
(e.g. [1., 2., 3])), the base functionality didn't change, so:
  1. document the parameter

NOTE:  For previously fully broken functionality, no deprecation is
       required.  An example of this is a function that didn't have all
       the arguments passed in.

Fast & Loose
============
It's a lot of work to document every function.  An current example of 
bdf/dev_vectorized.  It is a (near) total reimplementation of the BDF 
class.  Getting into the weeds a bit, the GRID card has a 
"get_position_by_node_id" and "get_position_by_node_index" method,
which function the same as the CQUAD4 method "get_node_ids_by_element_id"
or "get_node_ids_by_element_index".  Methods like these methods are
fundamental to the vectorized code and are repeated frequently repeated.

Thus, for a class method with a call signature like:
  - get_position_by_node_index(self, node_id=None)
  - get_position_by_node_id(self, i=None)
  - get_node_ids_by_element_id(self, element_id=None)
  - get_node_ids_by_element_index(self, i=None)
No documentation is required as it's considered to be self-documenting.

For a class method with a call signature like:
  - get_mass_by_element_id(self, xyz_cid0=None, element_id=None)
  - get_mass_by_element_index(self, xyz_cid0=None, i=None)
Only, the get_mass_by_element_id method will be documented.

NOTE:  The difference is there are additional attributes (and probably
falls into the #Duplicate Functions category previously discussed.

Still, in the case of something like bdf/dev_vectorized, the 
documentation requirements are so excessive, it nay just be 
"grandfathered" in.  For something like bdf/dev_io or bdf/dev_unicode
or op2/dev_v2, the API changes were/are small enough that documentation
isn't a big deal.

In the case of bdf/dev_vectorized, if it becomes bdf/vectorized, we're
bump the major version.  In the case of bdf/dev_io or bdf/dev_unicode,
the changes are theoretically small enough that we can just bump the 
minor versions.

Releasable vs. Non-Releasable
=============================
Code that exists in converters and GUI aren't really part of the main 
code.  These may just be dropped during release and as such shouldn't 
be subject to the same constraints.

The Code is Big
===============
To encourage the release process, it may just be a good idea to 
grandfather everything in.

#===================================================================
Release Process
===============
The standard obvious pieces apply:
  - Testing
  - Sphinx Documentation
  - Version bumping
  - Removal of deprecated code

Less obvious pieces:
  - Issues/Tickets
  - Release Notes
  - User Manual
  - Theory
  - iPython Examples

Tickets
=======
Can we parse the git log to get the list of closed tickets to 
put in the release notes?

Release Notes
=============
The following script would be useful:
  1.  Get the complete list of all classes/functions/methods 
  2.  Compare that list to the previous versions list
  3.  Put the difference (with some massaging) into the release notes

User Manual
===========
This should probably just be the Sphinx documentation.  Numpy doesn't 
have an official User's Manual, so why should pyNastran?

Theory
======
All relevant theory should be discussed in the area that implemnts it.
Things like the mass/stiffness matrix should be documented.  That the 
finite element method is a discritized model should not be.

iPython Examples
================
iPython is a neat way to demo the code.  Care should be taken to make 
sure these work for any user and are reasonably self-documenting.
