# python Octree v.1

# UPDATED:
# Is now more like a true octree (ie: partitions space containing objects)

# Important Points to remember:
# The OctNode positions do not correspond to any object position
# rather they are seperate containers which may contain objects
# or other nodes.

# An OctNode which which holds less objects than MAX_OBJECTS_PER_CUBE
# is a LeafNode; it has no branches, but holds a list of objects contained within
# its boundaries. The list of objects is held in the leafNode's 'data' property

# If more objects are added to an OctNode, taking the object count over MAX_OBJECTS_PER_CUBE
# Then the cube has to subdivide itself, and arrange its objects in the new child nodes.
# The new octNode itself contains no objects, but its children should.

# Psyco may well speed this script up considerably, but results seem to vary.

# TODO: Add support for multi-threading for node insertion and/or searching

#### Global Variables ####

# This defines the maximum objects an LeafNode can hold, before it gets subdivided again.
MAX_OBJECTS_PER_CUBE = 10

# This dictionary is used by the findBranch function, to return the correct branch index
DIRLOOKUP = {"3":0, "2":1, "-2":2, "-1":3, "1":4, "0":5, "-4":6, "-3":7}
