Load matrices from NASTRAN Output 4 (.op4) files.
Example:

  >>> import import pyNastran.op4.cython.op4 as op4
  >>> fh = op4.File(r'C:\work\sol103.op4', 'r')  # this should be the full path

    Creates a read object associated with the file sol103.op4.

  >>> fh.nmat

    Returns the number of matrices contained in the file.

  >>> fh.print_header()

    Prints detailed information on the matrices stored in the file.

  >>> K, M = fh.Load(skip=1, nmat=2)

    Loads the second and third matrices from the file sol103.op4 into K and M.

Limitations (these will be resolved in future releases):
    1. only handles dense matrices in text and binary op4 files
    2. unable to byte-swap files created on a different-endian machine
    3. unable to save Python arrays to new op4 files
