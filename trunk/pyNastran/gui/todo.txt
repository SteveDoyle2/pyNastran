both
====
 - cart3d input/output
 - nastran input/output
 - lawgs input
 - panair input
 - usm3d volume (postgrid) and results (.flo)
 - tetgen input
 - edges
 - nodal or centroidal
 - window title
 - auto-importing (meaning...)
 - loading of geometry/results from command line
 - implicit pulldown for formats
 - zoom/rotate/snap to axis
 - screenshot

wx unique
=========
 - hotkeys for zoom/rotate/snap to axis
 - explcit pulldown for formats

PyQt4 unique (PySide is broken)
===============================
 - logger
 - global axis
   - hide support
 - auto-reload button.  Useful for:
    - modifying Panair file
    - dynamically updating files
    - incrementing files for Usm3d (e.g. running a job and want to watch the
      flow develop without having to click load_results)
 - S/HABP input
 - Panair output
 - zoom/rotate/snap buttons
 - default filename for pictures
 - python scripting
 - pretty title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
 - legend menu to edit properties for:
   - title
   - min value
   - max value
   - data format (%f, %e, %g, %i, %.4f)
   - red to blue; blue to red
   - continuous to discrete (doesn't work)***
   - doesn't save results***
   - can't move legend***
   - can't show/hide legend***

----------------------------------------------------
---NOT DONE---

both
 - make both nodal/centroidal work regardless of flag
 - make vector results work
 - marker plots (arrows) & scale
 - displacement plots & scale
 - cell picker to get element/node info
 - usm3d surface/boundary layer/incomplete volume
 - results selector window rather than cycling

--------------
wx
 - axis
 - zoom/rotate/snap buttons
 - reload button
 - logging
 - plot3d hooks
 - default filename for pictues
 - python scripting
 - pretty title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
 - panair results (probably close)
 - shabp input
 - legend menu

--------------
qt
 - zoom/rotate/snap hotkeys
 - unbreak hotkeys (p, r, ???)
 - explcit pulldown for formats

---Format Specific---

Nastran
=======
 - load geometry -> .bdf/nas/dat
   - shows CAERO panels
 - load results -> op2/f06
   - SOL 101
     - (nodal/centroidal) stress
     - (nodal) displacement, velocity, acceleration, spcForces, mpcForces, temperatures
   - Stress
     - rodStress, barStress, beamStress, plateStress, solidStress, compositePlateStress (centroidal only)

 - ***multiple op2 files
 - ***show/hide elements based on picking
 - ***coordinate systems include Coord ID
 - ***multiple coordinate systems shown
 - ***transient-style results (need a results sidebar for that)
 - ***different nodal averaging methods (e.g.derive/avg, avg/derive)
 - ***interface loads

Cart3d
======
 - load geometry -> tri/triq
   - nodal -> eid
   - centroidal -> nid

 - results
   - nodal/centroidal -> Mach, Cp, rho, rhoU, rhoV, rhoW, rhoE, U, V, W, E
 - ***show/hide elements based on picking

Panair
======
 - load geometry -> inp
   - centroidal -> patch number, area x/y/z centroid location
   - nodal -> x/y/z node location
 - supports auto-reload of geometry
 - load results -> agps
   - nodal/centroidal - > Cp
 - ***show/hide panels based on menu/picking

LaWGS
=====
 - load geometry -> wgs
 - ***Coordinate System
Plot3d
======
 - ***plot3d input/output
 - ***show/hide panels based on menu/picking
      (wakes can be confusing otherwise)
 - ***2d vs 3d
 - ***Coordinate System

Tecplot
=======
 - ***tecplot structured input/output
 - ***tecplot unstructured input/output
 - ***Coordinate System

Tetgen
======
 - load geometry -> smesh
 - ***Coordinate System

STL
===
 - load geometry -> STL
 - ***Coordinate System

SHABP
=====
 - geometry (mk5/geo/inp)
   - location, patch number, component, impact, shadow
 - ***full trailer parsing
 - ***results parsing
 - ***show/hide panels based on menu/picking

Usm3d
=====
 - load geometry -> cogsg/front
 - load results -> flo, .aux.flo
   - old results not cleared out if loading both flo & aux.flo, so be careful
 - supports auto-reload of geometry and guesses for the latest result file

 - dynamic mapbc/bc file loading when input file loaded (if available)
 - dynamic flo output file loading on input
   - model_%i.flo will be found on load_geometry; where %i is the biggest number
     - supports autoreload
   - specific results file can be loaded with load results
 - ***Coordinate System

#BUGS

- qt
-------
 - Qt
   =======

 - nastran
   =======
   - single results (e.g. pid) can't have their legends edited
   - the Isat model seems to have something wrong with the Pid
   - what do elements with pid=0 correspond to?
 
 - panair
   =======
 
 - cart3d
   =======
 
 - shabp
   =======
   - trailer doesn't always parse properly

 - plot3d
   =======
   - doesn't work at all

- wx
