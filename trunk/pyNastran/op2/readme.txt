 - the dev_exlicit op2 branch is significantly more robust than the main op2 code
   due to an improved parsing approach.
 - It is not feature complete, so it is not the main OP2 parser.
 - the API for op2.py is the nearly the same (the init is slightly different).
 - the op2_vectorized.py is still in development.  It's slow, buggy, and changing.
