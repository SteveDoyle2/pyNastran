 - This version of the op2 is vectorized, so makes better use of memory..
 - It makes use of pandas, which may be removed in the future for numpy/HDF5.
   The API still needs work.
 - I've had repeated problems getting it to work across various cases
   (e.g. optmization), so it's on hold until dev_explicit is done
