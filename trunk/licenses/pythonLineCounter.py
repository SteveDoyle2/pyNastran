# Name:       pytonLineCounter.py (originally plc.py)
# Purpose:    A Python line counter.  Reports how many lines are in the given
#             input files, broken down into code, comment and blank lines.

#    Per discussion with Wayne, he has agreed to release this under the
#    LGPL license for pyNastran.  Updates for additional breakdowns were
#    added.  Wayne's script was also renamed for clarity.  It runs on a single
#    file, but creating a single file with all the pyNastran code allows plc to
#    run on the entire codebase.
