 The arbitrary beam cross section, explicit nonlinear (SOL 700), and the new
 nonlinear (SOL 400) solution sequences, are regarded as pre-release capabilities
 and are still undergoing testing and verification.  These capabilities should
 not be employed in any analysis except for the purpose of testing and verifying
 the functionality and working of the capabilities themselves.
  
 MSC.Nastran 2005 r2 is mainly focused on improving quality, accuracy and
 ease-of-use, but also introduces new capabilities, some of which were made
 available as pre-release functionality in MSC.Nastran 2005 r1. In addition,
 significant advancements have been made regarding performance and scalability of
 the program.  Some of the new features and enhancements are listed below.
  
 Nonlinear
 - MSC.Nastran Implicit Nonlinear (SOL 600) - We have addressed many known
   issues, improved memory usage, improved output options, added beam, bar, and
   shell offsets, and thermal contact
 - MSC.Nastran Explicit Nonlinear (SOL 700) pre-release - you can now
   execute LS-Dyna from inside MSC.Nastran to perform crash and impact
   analyses
  
 Numeric Enhancements
 - Multi-level DMP - an enhanced Lanczos modal extraction methodology that
   improves scalability and efficiently handles large normal modes analyses with
   very frequency ranges
 - MDACMS enhanced robustness, improved handling of large masses, and improved
   performance
 - Distributed memory parallel MPYAD
  
 Elements
 - CFAST - a new fastener element based on user defined stiffness values.
 - Arbitrary beam cross section pre-release capability - you can specify cross
   section shapes using POINT entries, and optimize them in SOL 200
 - Enhanced nonstructural mass element summary printout - ELSUM
1- spatially dependent heat transfer coefficient
 - Heat transfer coefficient as a function of two variables
 - Thermal analysis flux output
  
 Optimization
 - MSC.Nastran Topology Optimization - this addition to the existing SOL 200
   optimization solution sequence allows optimization analyses to be performed
   that require many design variables
  
 Further Enhancements
 - Larger XDB database support
 - MATMOD option 16 - we have removed many previous limitations with this
   matrix output capability
