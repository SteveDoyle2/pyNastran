-------------------------
Installation From Release
-------------------------

pyNastran is an easy package to install once you have the required Python modules.  It's a pure Python package so you shouldn't have too many problems.  On the command line:

``pip install pyNastran -U``

That will install the minimum set of what you need to run pyNastran (so no GUI).  If you want the GUI, there are two options.  On the command line, type:

    * ``pip install pyNastran[gui_pyside2] -U``
    * ``pip install pyNastran[gui_pyqt5]   -U``

Python
------
The software is tested on Windows and Linux against Python 3.9 - 3.12.

The latest dev version supports Python 3.9 - 3.12.

Install Procedure - From Source
*****************************************************
Base functionality:

 * `64-bit Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

On the command line, navigate to the directory with ``models``.  Then type:

 * ``pip install .``

If you would like to be able to modify the checked out source and have it have an effect, add ``-e`` before the ``.``:

 * ``pip install -e .``

If you would like pandas and hdf5 support to the BDF/OP2, but no gui options.

 * On the command line:

    * ``pip install .[nogui]``

For **optional** GUI support, there are two options:

 * On the command line:

    * ``pip install .[gui_pyside2]``
    * ``pip install .[gui_pyqt5]``

If you want to just install the dependencies yourself:

 * On the command line:

    * ``pip install . --no-dependencies``
