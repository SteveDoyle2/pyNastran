   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pyNastran's documentation for Master!
================================================
The pyNastran software interfaces to Nastran's complicated input and output
files and provides a simplified interface to read/edit/write the various files.
The software is compatible currently being used on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

The **BDF reader/editor/writer** supports 343 cards including coordinate
systems. Card objects have methods to access data such as Mass, Area, etc.
The BDF writer writes a small field formatted file, but makes full use of
the 8-character Nastran field. The OpenMDAO BDF parametrization syntax
is also supported.

The **OP2 reader** supports static/transient results, which unless you
analyzing frequency response data should be good enough. It also supports
**F06 Writing** for most of the objects. Results include: displacement,
velocity, acceleration, temperature, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, SPC forces,
MPC forces, grid point forces, load vectors, applied loads, strain energy,
as well as stress and strain.

The **Python OP4** reader/writer supports reading ASCII/binary sparse and dense
matrices, and writing ASCII matrices.

A simple GUI has been developed that can view BDF models and display static/dynamic
displacement/eignevectors (real/complex) and stress/strain (real) results from the OP2.
Additionally, AVUS, Cart3d, Usm3d, Tetgen, STL, and Panair are somewhat supported and
included for use.
