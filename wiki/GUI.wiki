= Setup Note =
Download the entire package from the [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/downloads/list Downloads] page or just the GUI.

If you download the source, make sure you follow the [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/wiki/InstallationGuide Installation Guide] and use *setup.py develop* and not *setup.py install*.  

If you're using Python 3.x, the GUI will *not* work because [http://wiki.wxpython.org/TentativeRoadmap wxPython] does not support Python 3.x (but it is [http://wiki.wxpython.org/ProjectPhoenix very close]).  Same with [http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Python_Wrapping_FAQ VTK].

= Introduction =

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was first introduced in version 0.3.0.  It is capable of displaying a BDF.  Work has begun on displaying the OP2, but is still preliminary.

The GUI looks like:

https://pynastran.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyNastran/gui/guiDemo.png

= Running the GUI =
On the command line:
{{{
>> pyNastranGUI

To view the options:
>> pyNastranGUI --help
usage: pyNastranGUI-script.py [-h] [-q] [-g] [-v]

Tests to see if an OP2 will work with pyNastran.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet    Prints debug messages (default=True)
  -g, --edges    Shows element edges as black lines (this option was changed to -e in the executable version and will be -e in future versions)
  -v, --version  show program's version number and exit
}}}

The *solidBending.bdf* and *solidBending.op2* files have been included as examples that work in the GUI.  They are inside the "models" folder (at the same level as setup.py).

== Graphical Issues ==
You'll have the best performance if you run the GUI on Windows with an new NVIDIA graphics card and on a desktop.

If you're having issues, you should update the driver for your graphics card, especially if you have a laptop or Radeon card. For a desktop machine, go to the web site of the manufacturer of the graphics card. For a laptop, you should normally go to the web site of the laptop manufacturer, though for NVIDIA you may now find a newer driver available from NVIDIA.

== TODO ==
 * Add a bar on the right hand side with OP2 results so you can select one, rather than cycling through them with the keyboard
 * support composite elements
 * allow edges to be shown without passing in a command line argument
 * Allow point picking (p)
 * Allow element picking (e)
 * Display element edges (d)
