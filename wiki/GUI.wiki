#summary features of the Graphical User Interface

= Introduction =

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was first introduced in version 0.3.0.  It is capable of displaying a BDF.  Work has begun on displaying the OP2, but is still preliminary.

An early version of the GUI looks like:

== TODO ==
 * Add a legend so you can see the value ranges/result name/subcase ID
 * Add a bar on the right hand side with OP2 results so you can select one, rather than cycling through them with the keyboard
 * display the values un-normalized (the values are normalized so the colors can be seen; default range is 0 to 1)
 * support non-solid elements
 * allow edges to be shown from without passing in a command line argument

= Supported Elements =
 * CQUAD4 / CQUAD8 (CQUAD5/6/7 represented as CQUAD4)
 * CTRIA3 / CTRIA6
 * CTETRA4 / CTETRA10
 * CHEXA8 / CHEXA20
 * CPENTA6 / CPENTA15
 * CBAR/CBEAM/CROD/CONROD/CELASx (displayed as lines)
 * CAERO1 (shown in yellow)
 * CONM2 (shown in yellow as points)
 

= BDF Requirements =
 * Entire model can be cross-referenced
 * No SPOINTs
 * Same requirements as BDF

= Features =
 * Load BDF file window (menu/button)
 * Load OP2 file window (menu)
 * Multiple Results Outputs
   * Centroidal Results Only (e.g. StressXX, StressYY, vonMisesStress)
   * Cycle through Results with 'L' key
 * Wireframe Mode (button/keyboard)
 * Surface/Solid Mode (button/keyboard)
 * Take a Screenshot (button/keyboard)
 * Snap to Axis (keyboard)
 * Change Background Color (button)
