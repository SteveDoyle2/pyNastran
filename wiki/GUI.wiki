#summary features of the Graphical User Interface

= Introduction =

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was first introduced in version 0.3.0 (unreleased).  It is capable of displaying a BDF.  Work has begun on displaying the OP2, but is still preliminary.

TheGUI looks like:

= Features =
 * Load BDF file window (menu/button)
 * Load OP2 file window (menu)
 * Multiple Results Outputs
   * Centroidal Results Only (e.g. StressXX, StressYY, vonMisesStress)
   * Cycle through Results with 'L' key
   * Contour Plots
   * Words that displays subcase ID, subtitle, max value, and the min value
 * Wireframe Mode (button/keyboard)
 * Surface/Solid Mode (menu/button/keyboard)
 * Take a Screenshot (menu/button/keyboard)
 * Snap to Axis (keyboard)
 * Change Background Color (menu)

= Supported Elements =
 * CQUAD4 / CQUAD8 (CQUAD5/6/7 represented as CQUAD4)
 * CTRIA3 / CTRIA6
 * CTETRA4 / CTETRA10
 * CHEXA8 / CHEXA20
 * CPENTA6 / CPENTA15
 * CBAR/CBEAM/CROD/CONROD/CELASx (displayed as lines)
 * CAERO1 (shown in yellow)
 * CONM2 (shown in yellow as points)
 

= BDF Requirements =
 * Entire model can be cross-referenced
 * No SPOINTs
 * Same requirements as BDF (include an executive/case control deck, define all cross-referenced cards, etc.)

= Mouse Controls =
|| *Command* || *Purpose* ||
|| Left Mouse Button || Rotate in 3D ||
|| Right Mouse Button || Zoom In/Out ||
|| Middle Mouse Button || Pan/Recenter Rotation Point ||
|| Shift + Left Mouse Button || Pan/Recenter Rotation Point ||

= Keyboard Controls =

|| *Key* || *Purpose* ||
|| i || Take a Picture (Image) ||
|| L   || Cycle through OP2 results ||
|| m/M || Increase/decrease magnification 1.1 times ||
|| o/O || Rotate clockwise/counter-clockwise 5 degrees ||
|| s   || Display surface mode    ||
|| w   || Display wireframe mode  ||
|| x/X || Snap to x/-x axis ||
|| y/Y || Snap to y/-y axis ||
|| z/Z || Snap to z/-z axis ||

== Warning ==
For proper performance, it is important to update the driver for your graphics card, especially if you have a Radeon card. For a desktop machine, go to the web site of the manufacturer of the graphics card. For a laptop, you should normally go to the web site of the laptop manufacturer, though for NVIDIA you may now find a newer driver available from NVIDIA.

== TODO ==
 * Add a bar on the right hand side with OP2 results so you can select one, rather than cycling through them with the keyboard
 * display the values un-normalized (the values are normalized so the colors can be seen; default range is 0 to 1; this might not be a problem)
 * support composite elements
 * allow edges to be shown from without passing in a command line argument
 * Allow point picking (p)
 * Allow element picking (e)
 * Display element edges (d)
