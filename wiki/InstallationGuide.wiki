= Install Procedure - User =

== Download Python ==
The software has been tested for Python 2.7.

I use *Python(x,y)-2.7.2.1*, but it shouldn't matter too much as long as your versions of numpy/scipy are consistent.  Python 2.6 and 2.7 are both fine, but the code uses a few features that aren't available in Python 2.5.  If you cannot update your Python, you still can use the code if you modify it slightly.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Welcome Python(x,y) ]
 * [http://scipy.org/ scipy 0.9.0  ]
 * [http://numpy.org/ numpy 1.5.1  ]
 * vtk 5.8.0
 * wxPython 2.8.12.0

== Download pyNastran ==
 * Click the downloads page and download the most recent [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/downloads/list version]

== Install pyNastran ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package

Enjoy!


= Install Procedure - Developer =

== Install Subversion ==
 * download install [http://tortoisesvn.net/ Subversion]
 * checkout the code (see the subversion website if you need help) and the [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/source/checkout Source]

== Install Doxygen ==
 * download and install [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/doxywizard_usage.html Doxygen ]

== Install pyNastran ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package

== Create the Documentation ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation

=== Non-Python 2.7 Windows ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from *C:\Python27\python.exe* to your executable location (likely *C:\Python26\python.exe* or some variation on that).  *NOTE* that Doxygen cares about the slash direction even if you're using cygwin and it works on the command line.

=== Linux Step ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from    *C:\Python27\python.exe* to your executable location (likely */usr/bin/python* or some variation on that)

Glad to have you aboard!
