= Install Procedure - User =

== Download Python ==
The software has been tested Python 2.6

I use *Python(x,y)-2.6.5.6*, but it shouldn't matter too much as long as your versions of numpy/scipy are consistent.  Python 2.4 to 2.7 are probably fine, but good luck!

 * Python(x,y)  http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Welcome
 * scipy 0.9.0  http://scipy.org/
 * numpy 1.5.1  http://numpy.org/


== Download pyNastran ==

Enjoy!


= Install Procedure - Developer =

== Install Subversion ==
 * download install Subversion.  I use http://tortoisesvn.net/

== Install Doxygen ==
 * download and install Doxygen http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/doxywizard_usage.html

== Install PyNastran ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package

== Create the Documentation ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation

=== Non-Python 2.6 Windows ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from *C:\Python26\python.exe* to your executable location (likely *C:\Python27\python.exe* or some variation on that).  *NOTE* that Doxygen cares about the slash direction even if you're using cygwin and it works on the command line.

=== Linux Step ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from    *C:\Python26\python.exe* to your executable location (likely */usr/bin/python* or some variation on that)

Glad to have you aboard!
