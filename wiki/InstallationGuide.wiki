#summary Walk through of how to install the project
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy


= Overview = 
 * Install Python
 * Install numpy
 * Install scipy
 * install Doxygen
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation
 * Download pyNastran (requires subversion or a released version)
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package
 * run *python all_tests.py* to verify the software


= Downloading Python =
The software has been tested Python 2.6

I use *Python(x,y)-2.6.5.6*, but it shouldn't matter too much as long as your versions of numpy/scipy are consistent.  Python 2.4 to 2.7 are probably fine, but good luck!

 * Python(x,y)  http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Welcome
 * scipy 0.9.0  http://scipy.org/
 * numpy 1.5.1  http://numpy.org/


= Downloading Doxygen =
 * install Doxygen http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/doxywizard_usage.html

= Downloading pyNastran =
 * Click the downloads page and download the most recent version

= Creating the Documentation =
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation

== Non-Python 2.6 Windows ==
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from *C:\Python26\python.exe* to your executable location (likely *C:\Python27\python.exe* or some variation on that).  *NOTE* that Doxygen cares about the slash direction even if you're using cygwin and it works on the command line.

== Linux Step ==
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from    *C:\Python26\python.exe* to your executable location (likely */usr/bin/python* or some variation on that)

= Installing PyNastran =
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package
 * run *python all_tests.py*.  This should run _*xxx*_ tests with *_0_* failures.
