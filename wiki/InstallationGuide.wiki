#summary Walkthrough of how to install the project
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =
 * pyNastran v0.3 is a very easy package to install once you have the required Python modules.  It's a pure Python package so no one should really be having too many problems.  The OP4 reader is an optional package that requires building of C code in addition to Cython.  Assuming you have a C compiler, it'll work.

= User Overview = 
 * Install Python
 * Install numpy, scipy, vtk, & wxPython
 * Install Cython for OP4 support
 * Download the latest pyNastran release
 * Extract the zip file
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package
 * run *make* in the *pyNastran/op4* directory

= Install Procedure - User =

== Download Python ==
The software has been tested for Python 2.7.

I use *Python(x,y)-2.7.2.1*, but it shouldn't matter too much as long as your versions of numpy/scipy are consistent.  Python 2.6 and 2.7 are both fine, but the code uses a few features that aren't available in Python 2.5.  If you cannot update your Python, you still can use the code if you modify it slightly.

 * [http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Welcome Python(x,y) ]
 * [http://scipy.org/ scipy 0.9.0  ]
 * [http://numpy.org/ numpy 1.6.1  ]
 * vtk 5.8.0
 * wxPython 2.8.12.0
 * Cython 0.15.1

== Install Cython and C compiler==
 * Windows: Install [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 ([http://wiki.tiker.net/PyCuda/Installation/Windows follow this]).  The version of Visual Studio is important as Python is built against MSVC 2008.  Don't worry, it's free.
 * Linux/Mac: Install gcc
 * Open a command prompt / terminal
 * run *easy_install cython==0.15.1* to install Cython

== Download pyNastran ==
 * Click the downloads page and download the most recent [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/downloads/list version]

== Install pyNastran ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install pyNastran.  Don't type *python setup.py install*

== Install OP4 Reader ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran/op4 directory on the command line

===Windows===
 * run *make* to install the OP4 code
 * if that doesnt work, try *python setup.py build_ext --compiler=mingw32 --inplace*

Enjoy!

= Developer Overview = 
 * Install Python
 * Install numpy, scipy, vtk, & wxPython
 * install Doxygen
 * Install Cython (if you want OP4 support)
 * Use subversion to checkout pyNastran
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install the package

= Install Procedure - Developer =

== Install Subversion ==
 * download install [http://tortoisesvn.net/ Subversion]
 * checkout the code (see the subversion website if you need help) and the [http://code.google.com/p/pynastran/source/checkout Source]

== Install Doxygen ==
 * download and install [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/doxywizard_usage.html Doxygen ]

== Install Cython ==
 * Open a command prompt / terminal
 * run *easy_install cython==0.15.1* to install Cython

== Install pyNastran ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop* to install pyNastran

== Create the Documentation ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *doxygen Doxyfile* to generate the documentation

== Install OP4 Reader ==
 * Navigate to pyNastran/op4 directory on the command line
 * run *make* to install the OP4 code

=== Non-Python 2.7 Windows ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from *C:\Python27\python.exe* to your executable location (likely *C:\Python26\python.exe* or some variation on that).  *NOTE* that Doxygen cares about the slash direction even if you're using cygwin and it works on the command line.

=== Linux Step ===
 * open Doxyfile in a text editor and change the python path from    *C:\Python27\python.exe* to your executable location (likely */usr/bin/python* or some variation on that)

Glad to have you aboard!
