#summary Walk through of how to install the project


= Overview = 
 * Install Python, numpy, scipy
 * Download pyNastran (requires subversion)
 * Navigate to pyNastran directory on the command line
 * run *python setup.py develop*
 * run *python all_tests.py*.  This should run _*xxx*_ tests with *_0_* failures.

= Obtaining Python =
The software has been tested Python 2.6

I use Python(x,y)-2.6.5.6, but it shouldn't matter too much as long as your versions of numpy/scipy are consisnent.  Python 2.4 to 2.7 are probably fine, but good luck!

 * Python(x,y)  http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Welcome
 * scipy 0.9.0  http://scipy.org/
 * numpy 1.5.1  http://numpy.org/
