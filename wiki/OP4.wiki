#summary How to use the OP4 Reader

= Introduction =
The OP4 reader is a an ASCII (text) or binary reader for Nastran OP4 files.  It can *ONLY* read *dense* matrices.  Sparse matrices are not supported yet.

See the InstallationGuide for how to install the OP4 Reader.

=Load Matrices from NASTRAN Output 4 (.op4) Files=
Example:

  >>> from pyNastran.op4.op4 import OP4

    Load the OP4 reader
  
  >>> fh = OP4('sol103.op4', 'r')

    Creates a read object associated with the file sol103.op4.

  >>> fh.nmat

    Returns the number of matrices contained in the file.

  >>> fh.print_header()

    Prints detailed information on the matrices stored in the file.

  >>> K, M = fh.Load(skip=1, nmat=2)

    Loads the second and third matrices from the file sol103.op4 into K and M.

==Limitations==
These will be resolved in future releases:
    1. Only handles dense matrices in text and binary op4 files
    2. Unable to byte-swap files created on a different-endian machine
    3. Unable to save Python arrays to new op4 files

==Special Thanks==
Al Danial has done a great job of putting the OP4 reader together.  It's written using Cython and generates numpy matrices, so it's very fast.
