#summary Introduction to the PyNastran Project.

= Introduction =
This project is an "attempt" at an open-source Python-C++ implementation of the Nastran-style format.  By using an open-source approach, users will be able to add new cards that they desire, with convenient and robust functions to enable that.  

The software's primary goals are to enable the user to:
 * read, write, edit a BDF without losing precision
 * read an F06
 * read an OP2

Eventually, as the software matures, the plan is to also support the calculation of mass and stiffness matrix for the various elements.  With this capability, the user will be able to perform a finite element analysis of their model without using any expensive tokens.
