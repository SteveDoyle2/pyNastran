#summary Usage of the Op2 Reader

= Introduction =

This is how the version 0.2 OP2 reading software works if you're interested.  *Don't try and use the version 0.1 software unless you have a very simple CQUAD4 static model.*

from pyNastran.op2.op2 import OP2

infileName = 'fem.op2'

op2Obj = OP2(infileName)  # instantiates the object
op2Obj.read()  # yup, that simple...


# lets assume the code crashed on the GEOM1 table...
# let's read only the OES1X1 (isotropic stress table)
op2Obj2 = OP2(infileName)  # instantiates the object
op2Obj2.tablesToRead = set(['OES1X1'])
op2Obj2.read()

# lets print the results
print op2Obj.printResults() # prints ALL results from ALL tables

# lets print the plate stress only
# and then print oxx and ovm (x-stress and von mises stress)
for iSubcase,stressCase in op2Obj.plateStress.items():
    print stressCase

    for eid in stressCase:
        print stressCase[eid].oxx
        print stressCase[eid].ovm

## NOTE:  there are no interface methods to these objects yet...
