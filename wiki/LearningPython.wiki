#summary not everyone knows Python, here's how to get started:

= Introduction =

Python is a one of the easiest languages there is to program in.  It's easier than C++, Matlab, Perl, Fortran (all languages I've used).  It's also free.  It comes with a lot of built-in functions, which means you won't ever have to code those very common functions (path manipulation, file copying, etc.).  The book [http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ Learn Python the Hard Way] (free for the HTML version) is a good place to start.  [http://www.diveintopython.net/ Dive Into Python] is another great HTML book.

== Basic Math (Python 2.x)==
Python distinguishes between integers and floats.
When you first learned division:
5/3 = 1 remainder 2

Eventually, you started doing:
5/3 = 1.666

Python treats:
5/3 = 5//3 = 1 (the truncated result)

and:
5%3 = 2 (the remainder)

5/3.0 = 5.0/3 = 1.666 (an input is a float, so the outputs is a float)

It's strongly recommended that all integer division in Python be done as:
5//3 and not 5/3

because:
5/3 = 1.666
in Python 3.
