# News

### Wiki Notes

There is still a bit of updating left to do on the Wiki.  The outdated wiki pages will be updated soon.

## pyNastran v0.7.2 has been Released (4/25/2015)

[Download pyNastran v0.7] (https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pyNastran/releases)

This is a bug fix release.

## pyNastran v0.7.1 has been Released (4/17/2015)

Some of the changes include:
 * OP2
   * superelement support
   * vectorized support (uses much less memory; Element Forces not vectorized yet)
   * additional results (e.g. grid point weight, eigenvalues)
   * `PARAM,POST,-2` support
   * catching of most FATAL errors without needing to read the F06
 * F06
   * removed
 * BDF
   * 238 BDF cards
   * large field format and double precision writing
 * GUI
   * much improved GUI with transient support (real only), a results sidebar, logging, and scripting support
 * Other
   * additional readers/converters to/from various other formats (e.g. STL, Cart3d, Panair) as well as GUI support
   * Python 2/3 support with a single code base
   * autogenerated online documentation for pyNastran using [readthedocs](https://rwww.readthedocs.org) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)

As always there are many bug fixes and many new tests.

Additionally, there have also been many API changes.  It's a frustrating step, but pyNastran is adopting PEP-8.
Where possible, old methods will be maintained until v0.8, but that is not always possible.  If an old method is not supported and hadn't previouly been deprecated, make a ticket/issue and if it can be supported, it will be added back.  

Additionally, most op2 object were changed in order to eliminate errors, and be more consistent.  For example, `plateStress` has been replaced by `ctria3_stress`, `cquad4_stress`, `ctria6_stress`, etc.  Also, plate centroids now have a `node_id` of `0`.  This greatly simplifies F06 writing and vectorized data extraction.

### pyNastran has Moved (3/12/2015)
Google Code is  [closing down](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html)
on January 25, 2016 and as such pyNastran has moved to [github](https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pynastran).
New commits will now be made on github.  The wiki is currently in the process of being migrated to github.


### GUI (v0.7 pre-release; 12/2014)
Google Code no longer supports new downloads.
As such, the download page will now be located at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pynastran/files/?source=navbar).  The much improved dev version of the [GUI](https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pynastran/wiki/GUI) is located there.
v0.6.1 and earlier releases will still be located at Google Code (at least for now).

### Version 0.6.1 has been released (6/2013)
**Version 0.6** improves BDF reading.  The reader is more robust and also requires proper BDF field formatting (e.g. a integer field can't be a float).  Additionally, cards also have a comment() method.

Marcin Gąsiorek participated in the latest pyNastran under the European Space Agency's (ESA) "Summer of Code In Space" [SOCIS](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2012/?q=node/13) program.  The program provides a stipend to students to work on open-source projects.
He did a great job of simplifying code and creating nicer documentation.

## Additional Info

If anyone makes any specific requests I'll try to incorporate them.  They need to be specific, such as read these cards from the BDF, read these results from this OP2, or write these results to an OP2.  <b>Any sample problems that you have (to test the software with) would be appreciated.  I need small examples that are comprehensive that I can add as demo problems.</b>
